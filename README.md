# CCC-Question-Checker

### How to use

1. Edit the `solution` function according to the question you are doing in Main.cpp
2. Edit the string argument in `Main.cpp` on line 18 to the name of the question (e.g. "j2" or "s1").
3. Compile, then put the executable in either the `junior_data` (if the question name is "j#") or `senior_data` folder (if the question name is "s#"), and run it.

And it will do all the test cases for you.
