# CCC-Question-Checker

### How to use

1. Edit the `solution` function according to the question you are doing in `Main.cpp`
2. Edit the string argument in `Main.cpp` on line 42 to the name of the question (e.g. "j2" or "s1").
3. Choose the mode you want to use with the enum on line 43 (either ProvidedTestCases or CustomInput).
4. Compile, then put the executable in either the `junior_data` (if the question name is "j#") or `senior_data` folder (if the question name is "s#"), and run it.

And if you chose ProvidedTestCases, it will do all the test cases for you. Otherwise, you will have to input manually.
